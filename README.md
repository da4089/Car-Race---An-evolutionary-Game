# Car Race; A Genetic Algorithm

## demo_code.py
This is the code, where you can make your own car racing simulations. It's a very short and easy code and there are variouse of hyperparameters that you can change (parser arguments). You should not need any special pre-installation since basically it's all numpy.

Have fun!:)

### So far, I have not found the time to make more coments - also the project is still in progress... 
However, I think there are enough comments for the more python-experienced reader.
